It can be used to filter information, change variables inside of a column, summaries, and it can even add columns based on existing. From the data set used, I noticed there was a lot of tiding need in the data before manipulation. Especially when most numeric values were interpreted as strings and therefore needed corrections. If I had more time, I would work on making the Size column into a float variable and not a string variable. Below you can even see the code I started to work on to do just that, but it got complex. As you can see in the data set the Size columns had an M next to its variables. I though I could just drop that value, but I then ran into other issues. There were also variables with k next to its variables as well as column which said, “Varies with device”. Too correct everything, I know I would need to change the columns that said “Varies with device” into NaN values and figure out a way to take the M and k values and multiply them by a million and a thousand respectfully (or something like that). \n"
